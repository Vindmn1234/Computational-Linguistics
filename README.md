# Computational-Linguistics
Conduct websrcapping to get consumer feed back from several website pages.  Based on the context use pretained BERT model and the NLTK library to conduct sentiment analysis
Build a simple N-Gram model and LSTM model respectively to conduct word prediction based on the wikitext corpus.
Add two kinds of noises(missing mispelling and masked words) corpus with different proportions(5%, 15% and 30%). Compared their performance and robustness
in terms of accuracy and preplexity on the original corpus and noise corpus.
